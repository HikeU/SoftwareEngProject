# SoftwareEngProject
Github Repository for Software Engineering group project

App development is based in Adalo, so are mostly using that to track app versions, but it is not a public development platform like Github.
Because the .apk is a complete application file bundle, it is encrypted, so the code is not readable by examining the file directly.
The .apk file can be used in Android Studio as we indicate in the Demo 1 README files.
Since the .apk file is also a complete folder that includes all resources the app needs in order to run, it is too large to upload directly to GitHub.
